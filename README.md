# MothEradication
MothEradication is a python and Machine Learning based project. The Main aim of this project is to eradicate the moths and control the spread of moths through traps.
Region containing the trap is defined as a polygon.
The traps located on the perimeter of the polygon are tested and successfully eradicated.
Number of trapes and Location of traps in the region are given as input.
The outputs produced are Location of traps present on the perimeter and length of the perimeter of region.
For this, we have used ConvexHull and Matplotlib approaches.
This also includes Javis Algorithm which means to take minimum number of traps(points) to form a polygon.
